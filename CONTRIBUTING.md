# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to **Open Code Chicago**!  
We welcome contributions of all skill levels.

---

## Before You Start
- Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Check out the [Usage Guide](./docs/usage.md) to run the project locally
- Look at [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCodeChicago/hacktoberfest-2025-infra/issues) to see where you can help
- Review our [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCodeChicago/projects/2) to see **available tasks**  
  - Comment on the task you’d like to work on so a maintainer can assign it to you  
  - This helps avoid duplicate work and keeps efforts coordinated 

---

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Pick a task** from the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCodeChicago/projects/2) or from [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCodeChicago/hacktoberfest-2025-infra/issues)  
   - Comment to claim it before starting work 
3. **Create a branch** for your work (e.g. `feature/awesome-feature` or `fix/typo`)  
4. **Make your changes** and commit with clear, descriptive messages  
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch  
   - Reference any related issues (e.g. `Closes #123`)  
   - Keep PRs small and focused — easier to review and merge  

---

## Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages  
- Keep your PR focused on a single change  
- Follow code style (Prettier config is included in the project)
- Run `npm run lint` before pushing 
- Write clean, well-documented code  
- Add/update tests if relevant  

---

## Dependencies & Packages
- All dependencies are tracked in `package.json`.  
- Please **do not install or commit new packages** without first discussing in an issue or PR.  
- If you believe a new dependency is required:
  1. Open or comment on an issue explaining why it’s needed.  
  2. Wait for maintainer approval before adding it.  
- The `node_modules` folder should **not** be committed — it is auto-generated by `npm install`.  
- Always run `npm install` after cloning the repo to get the correct dependencies.

## Get Recognized with the All-Contributors Bot
We use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) to recognize and celebrate all types of contributions. 

**How to add yourself:**
1. After your Pull Request is merged, comment on the PR or in a new issue with:
   ```
   @all-contributors please add @your-github-username for code, doc, ideas
   ```
   - Replace `@your-github-username` with your GitHub handle.
   - List your contribution types (e.g., `code`, `doc`, `ideas`, `bug`, `review`).
   - [See all contribution types here.](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)

2. The bot will create a Pull Request to add you to the contributors table in the README.
3. A maintainer will review and merge the bot’s PR.

**Example:**
```
@all-contributors please add @Alexandrbig1 for code, doc, maintenance, projectManagement
``` 

If you have questions, ask in your PR or open an issue!
